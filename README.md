# CS-Stretch
A simple batch script using CursorLock + Qres to change your aspect ratio to 4:3, launch CS:GO, lock your cursor to the game and put your aspect ratio back after closing the game - This allows you to play borderless as if it was fullscreen

## Usage 
Download as a zip and unzip to a convenient location.
Make sure qres.exe is in the "qres" folder and that it's up to date - [check here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/qres/files/latest/download) (unlikely as it hasn't been updated since 2013)

## Config
Set line 2 to what Width (x), Height (y) and Hz (f) you want to play with.
Set line 3 to your CursorLock.exe directory [Download](http://www.snakebytestudios.com/download/cursor-lock/), your steam.exe directory and csgo.exe directory.
Set line 5 to your standard desktop settings - width, height and frequency.
