# CS-Res
Windowed Fullscreen is great as it lets you alt tab easily without the game crashing/lagging or closing in the background. but You can't automatically change your resolution like with fullscreen and it's a hastle to automatically change it. There's also a bug where if you move too fast your cursor will go off the monitor and you'll close the game. But this batch file fixes this by making use of [QRes](https://sourceforge.net/projects/qres/files/latest/download) and [CursorLock](http://www.snakebytestudios.com/download/cursor-lock/)

## Usage 
Download as a zip and unzip to a convenient location.
Run setup.sh and follow the steps

Steam.exe should be at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steam.exe but it may be different. To find it search steam in the start menu > open file location > right click on Steam > open file location and at the top bar will be your directory. Just add steam.exe to the end.

csgo.exe should be at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\csgo.exe but it may be different. To find it go to csgo on steam > right click > properties > local files > browse

## Performance

This runs a simple batch script to change resolution when closed and CursorLock.exe to lock your cursor to the game.

This may impact performance by the smallest amount but I haven't found any difference.

You won't get banned from using this as it's just a batch script and a well known program but by running this program you take full responsibility
