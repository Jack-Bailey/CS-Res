# CS-Stretch
A simple batch script using CursorLock + Qres to change your aspect ratio to 4:3, launch CS:GO, lock your cursor to the game and put your aspect ratio back after closing the game - This allows you to play borderless as if it was fullscreen

## Usage 
Download as a zip and unzip to a convenient location.
Run setup.sh and follow the steps

Steam.exe should be at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steam.exe but it may be different. To find it search steam in the start menu > open file location > right click on Steam > open file location and at the top bar will be your directory. Just add steam.exe to the end.

csgo.exe should be at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\csgo.exe but it may be different. To find it go to csgo on steam > right click > properties > local files > browse

## Performance

This runs a simple batch script to change resolution when closed and CursorLock.exe to lock your cursor to the game.

This may impact performance by the smallest amount but I haven't found any difference.

You won't get banned from using this as it's just a batch script and a well known program but by running this program you take full responsibility
